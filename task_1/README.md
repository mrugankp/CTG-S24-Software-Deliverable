# README for task_1

## Documentation:

In this task, we need to provide documentation covering the following:

1. Instructions on accessing and interpreting the data.
2. A summary of any issues encountered and the solutions applied.
3. Steps to run the code and potential issues and fixes.

Please refer to the README file for detailed documentation.
# FILEPATH

def task_1(data):
        """
        This function performs task 1 on the given data.

        Parameters:
        data (list): A list of data to be processed.

        Returns:
        result (int): The result of task 1.

        Raises:
        ValueError: If the data is empty.

        """
        if not data:
                raise ValueError("Data cannot be empty.")

        # Perform task 1 on the data
        result = ...

        return result

# Running the code:
To run the code, you can call the `task_1` function and pass in the data as a list. Make sure the data is properly formatted and contains the required information.

# Potential issues and fixes:
- Issue: Empty data list
    - Fix: The code raises a `ValueError` if the data list is empty. Make sure to provide valid data to avoid this error.

- Issue: Incorrect data format
    - Fix: Ensure that the data is in the correct format as expected by the `task_1` function. Check the documentation for the required data format.

- Issue: Missing dependencies
    - Fix: If the code relies on external libraries or modules, make sure they are installed and imported correctly before running the code. Numpy, Pandas, yfinance.

- Issue: Unexpected results
    - Fix: If the code produces unexpected results, double-check the logic and verify that the input data is correct. Debugging and testing can help identify and fix any issues.

Remember to handle any other potential issues specific to your use case and provide appropriate fixes.
